    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>Here you'll find the most important information about Club Manager 2019's online game</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ManualText1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>You can get new players from cards or send scouts, tell them what post you are looking for, and he goes to the field to look for the player. In 24 hours he will return and offer those players who can be bought.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ManualText10" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>You get the cash after every game you play, the value depends on the outcome of the match, you have the most, of course, the win, then the draw and the least for the win. Another way to get cash is to sell cards.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ManualText11" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>You can play league matches more often if you improve your organizer's level. You can play an exhibition match with cards or 100 coins.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ManualText2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Card Packages can be obtained in several ways. At the beginning of the game you get 3 opening packages, you can pick up one every 24 hours. Another option is to watch an ad video. This option always appears at a certain point. You get cards even after the matches played, whether league or exhibition. The last option is to buy cards for money or coins. Individual packages are distinguished by the number of cards inside and scarce.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ManualText3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Each manager prefers a particular layout. The only way to change the layout is to replace the manager. Each manager has a certain capacity, that is, the sum of the quality of all basic eleven players. If the sum exceeds the managerial capacity, team chemistry will rapidly decrease.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ManualText4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Team chemistry can range from 1 to 99. The higher your team's team chemistry, the better players and the manager work together to give better performance in matches. Team chemistry is changing for the following reasons: &lt;br/&gt;
Manager Change - If you change a team manager, team chemistry will usually decrease. To reach a higher team chemistry, you need to play as many games as possible. &lt;br/&gt;
The sum of the players' basic qualities will exceed the manager's capacity. &lt;br /&gt;
Change of report - Each player has different relationships with the manager and team team chemistry.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ManualText5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Team quality is not the only aspect that will help you win the game. It is important to have a player rested, to a high team chemistry with a manager. Of course, you have to choose a good tactic and identify the right players for the standard situation. The home playground and its level also play a big part. You can also increase your chances by sending the team to a concentration camp. Of course, if you have a four-attack run, you probably have more goals, but you probably get more cash.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ManualText6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Player oddity is very important in matches. If players are tired, they do not perform well. Increase energy with energy cards. They are of two types, energy recovery for the whole team and energy recovery for one player. In addition, the player rests when he does not join the next match, either league or exhibition. It is therefore advantageous to alternate their basic eleven and to save their main levers in league leagues.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ManualText7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Each player can be trained to the 50th level. At this level, the player will improve his ability by 10 points. The higher the level your gym will have, the more effective your training will be. Training can be started using training cards. If you want to speed up the training of players, you will improve your training background. If you upgrade it to the 12th, 25th, 37th and 50th levels, you can train multiple players at the same time.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ManualText8" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>To get more clubs in the game, you do not have to create another profile. You only have to play 25 matches and get the second team, you will get it again with the basic equipment. You can easily switch between clubs. You can have up to 4 clubs in the game. After playing 100 league matches, you will get 3rd Club. Then, after 250 league games, the 4th club.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ManualText9" xml:space="preserve">
